This is a client library in c# to demonstrate the usage of the [signhost api](https://api.signhost.com/) using .net.
You will need a valid APPKey and APIKey.
You can request a APPKey for signhost at [ondertekenen.nl](https://portal.signhost.com/signup/api-aanvraag).

### Install
Get it on NuGet:

`PM> Install-Package SignhostClientLibrary`

### Example code
The following code is an example of how to create and start a sign transaction with two documents.
```c#
var settings = new SignHostApiClientSettings(
	"AppName appkey",
	"apikey or usertoken"));

var client = new SignHostApiClient(settings);

var transaction = await client.CreateTransactionAsync(new Transaction {
	Signers = new List<Signer> {
		new Signer {
			Email              = "john.doe@example.com",
			SignRequestMessage = "Could you please sign this document?",
			SendSignRequest    = true,
			/*
			 * The verifications listed here are executed in order.
			 * Your last verification _must_ be one of the following:
			 * - PhoneNumberVerification
			 * - ScribbleVerification
			 * - ConsentVerification
			 */
			Verifications      = new List<IVerification> {
				new PhoneNumberVerification {
					Number = "+3161234567890",
				},
				new ScribbleVerification {
					ScribbleName           = "John Doe",
					RequireHandsignature   = true,
				},
			},
		},
	},
});

await client.AddOrReplaceFileToTransactionAsync(
	"PathToFile",
	transaction.Id,
	"First document",
	new FileUploadOptions());

await client.AddOrReplaceFileToTransactionAsync(
	"PathOtherFile",
	transaction.Id,
	"General agreement",
	new FileUploadOptions());

/* When everything is setup we can start the transaction flow. */
await client.StartTransactionAsync(transaction.Id);

```
